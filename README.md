> **Course:** YU-DIGT Software Engineering  
> **Deliverable:** 3 - Implementation and Testing
> **Date:** March 22, 2026

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Real Estate Management System (REMS)** is a comprehensive, web-based software solution designed to automate commercial property management for large-scale mall developments.

Large real estate companies currently face inefficiencies due to fragmented tools and manual processes, resulting in double-booked appointments and billing errors. REMS solves this by centralizing workflows—from leasing and billing to maintenance—into a unified platform.

## ✨ Key Features
REMS is designed with the following core functional modules:

### 🏪 Property & Unit Management
* **Inventory Control:** Track store size, location, rental tier, classification, and tenant purpose.
* **Multi-Mall Support:** Manage multiple mall properties with distinct inventories.
* **Smart Search:** Tenants can filter units by price, size, and availability.

### 📅 Scheduling & Leasing
* **Conflict-Free Booking:** Automated logic prevents double-booking of viewing appointments.
* **Digital Applications:** Electronic submission of rental applications with file uploads.
* **E-Leases:** Auto-generated lease agreements with electronic signature support.

### 💳 Automated Billing
* **Consolidated Invoicing:** Combines base rent, electricity, water, and waste charges into a single monthly bill.
* **Flexible Cycles:** Supports monthly, quarterly, or annual billing logic.
* **Discount Logic:** Automatically applies discounts for tenants leasing multiple units.

### 🛠️ Maintenance Portal
* **Ticket System:** Tenants can submit maintenance requests online.
* **Smart Escalation:** Emergency requests are automatically prioritized and escalated.
* **Misuse Billing:** Logic to charge tenants for maintenance caused by misuse.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
Based on the project specifications:

* **Language:** Python
* **Framework:** Flask
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Testing:** Pytest
* **Architecture:** Layered or MVC (Model-View-Controller)
* **Frontend:** Mobile-friendly & Responsive Interface
